<h1>CRIME ANALYSIS - SQL SERVER 2022 / POWER BI</h1>

<P>
 This project analyses criminal data from the state of Florida. I wanted to know what the crime trends in my area looked like and, in this project, I dived deep into FBI data that was reported by local law enforcement. Featuring eye catching dashboards, this crime analysis report can be beneficial to any police department looking to implement proactive policing in the community. This report is also beneficial to local real estate companies such as Zillow and Redfin, as well as any individual who is looking to move to the state of Florida.

<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis:</h2>

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Which city had the highest violent crimes in the recent year (2019)</li>
  <li>What's the total amount of crimes comitted overall</li>
  <li>How has crime changed over time</li>
  <li>What is the most popular type of crime</li>
</ol>

<h3>Findings:</h3>


<ol>
  <li>To my surprise, the city that had the highest amount of violent crimes in 2019 was Jacksonville.Florida. Miami is 2nd followed by Orlando. Making these 3 city the top 3 cities with the most violent crimes in 2019. Violent crimes being classifed by law enforcement as anything involving murder, rape, aggravated assault, and robery</li>
  <li>The total amount of crimes comitted and reported to law enforcement between 2017 and 2019 were 2 million. It is important to know that not every crime that is comittted in the U.S is reported. The actual number could be more.</li>
  <li>Fortunetly from the crime that is reported, there is a downward trend. Unfortunetly there is no data available from recent years to show if this trend continues post Covid.</li>
  <li>The most popular type of crime is property crimes. This is an intersting finding as this can help local citizens and law enforcement initiate a more proactive policing approach in order to keep a safe community. This also helps real estate investors re-think investing in a paritcular area.</li>
